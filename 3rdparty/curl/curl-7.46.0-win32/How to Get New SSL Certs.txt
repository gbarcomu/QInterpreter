SSL Certificate Bundles
=======================

To generate a new SSL certificate bundle:

1. Open Windows Explorer and go to the folder where cURL is installed. By
   default it is either C:\Program Files\cURL or C:\Program Files (x86)\cURL
   
2. Double click mk-ca-bundle.vbs, or if you have Perl, mk-ca-bundle.pl. The
   script will download a new SSL bundle from Mozilla. It will be called
   ca-bundle.crt.
   
3. Rename the file curl-ca-bundle.crt.

4. Drag it into the bin folder.

5. You will be notified that a file with that name already exists in the bin
   folder. Choose the option to replace the old file.
